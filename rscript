# Smaller Defined Spatial Unit Example ------------------------------------

### Here is a small example to show how to pull out the Census Tracts for a specific MSA (the 6 county Detroit MSA)
# First we define a new dataframe.  Since it isn't all US counties, we call it DetroitMSACT
# You should notice some other differences in the code
# The geography was changed from "county" to "tract" because we want the smaller spatial unit
# variables, Survey, Year, Output stay the same (it will bring back same variables from same year in the same way)
# The state="" is new and here you could define the state.  We want the Detriot MSA so its only "MI", but if you wanted to add more, you could with state=c("MI", "OH", ...)
# The county= argument is also new.  here you can define the specific counties you would want to pull.  the c("county1name", "county2name", etc) comes from the MSA counties for 
Idahozcta<-get_acs(geography = "tract",  #Defining the spatial scale
                      variables = Variables, #grabbing the variables we defined previously
                      survey = "acs5",      # survey we are pulling is the ACS 5 year estimates
                      year = 2020,   # End year for the 5 year estimates- 2016-2020
                      output = "wide", # data format wide (cross sectional)
                      state="ID", # Define which State you want to pull data from
                      county= c("Lemhi", "Valley", "Boise", "Idaho"), # Defining the counties in the state that the data will come from
                      geometry=T) # Pulls the spatial data information with it.


# First 10 records/observations return
head(Idahozcta)

# summary() provides an overview of the data
summary(Idahozcta)

# Lets clean up this data a little bit before we go too far
# Here we are just pulling out the columns we care about using the indexing dataframe[,c("column name","etc")]
Idaho<-Idahozcta[,c("GEOID", "NAME", "MHIE", "MHVE", "TotalpopE", "geometry")]
# Easy renaming of the variables
names(Idaho)[names(Idaho) =="MHIE"]<-"MHI"
names(Idaho)[names(Idaho) =="MHVE"]<-"MHV"
names(Idaho)[names(Idaho) =="TotalpopE"]<-"Totalpop"


### Setting up the color palletes
DpalMHI<-colorQuantile(palette = "viridis", domain=Idaho$MHI, n=10)
DpalMHV<-colorQuantile(palette = "RdYlBu", domain=Idaho$MHV, n=10)
Dpalpop<-colorQuantile(palette = "RdBu", domain=Idaho$Totalpop, n=10)


### The Leaflet map
## Named map
